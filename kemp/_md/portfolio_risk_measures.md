## Risk Measurement Theory

### Portfolio Specific Risk Measures

#### Grammar
common tools:

* value at risk
* expected shortfall
* tracking error
* stress testing

joint probability distribution between multiple risk factors

ex-post risk measure - measure past
ex-ante risk measure - forward looking

absolute return objective employed by hedge funds - An Absolute Return fund is a type of investment vehicle that attempts to generate steady, positive returns in all market environments by using a variety of investment strategies such as derivatives, arbitrage, short selling, leverage, and more.

tracking error - 



#### Logic

| Objective Type                  | Typical Benchmark                          | What "Risk" Means                          |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Absolute Return (e.g., hedge fund) | Cash returns (e.g., LIBOR, SONIA)         | Losing money or underperforming cash       |
| Long-only portfolio             | Market index (e.g., FTSE 100, S&P 500)     | Underperforming the market index           |
| Liability-driven investment     | Index proxy **or** required cash flows     | Failing to meet liabilities or cash flow goals |

split portfolio risk into 2:

* the choice of benchmark against risk is measured
* the measure that quantifies "how far away" the portfolio is from the benchmark


#### Rhetoric

### Questions
the description of drawdown expost risk measure is not clear to me.  some mathematics would help clear up the ambiguity in my mind.
