# why do bank balance sheets increase with securitisation
it is a bit like fractional reserving  
i.e where deposit -> loan -> deposit -> loan  
multiplies credit via fractional reserving

for securitisation the loop is:  
originate loan -> securitise -> originate loan -> securitise  
multiplies credit  

a final point:  
if only banks purchased securitiesed assets then bank balance sheets would not have grown in aggregate  
the key to aggregate growth in bank balance sheets is that securitised assets were offloaded to non-bank institutions
